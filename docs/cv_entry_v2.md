**ShelfWatch** | **Python, YOLO11L, AWS EKS, FastAPI, Docker, ONNX Runtime** | **2025**
• Engineered an end-to-end MLOps pipeline on AWS EKS, deploying a fine-tuned YOLO11L model as a scalable microservice using Docker and Kubernetes.
• Optimized inference performance by 4x, achieving sub-500ms latency on CPU nodes through ONNX Runtime and INT8 quantization.
• Implemented full-stack observability with Prometheus and Grafana to monitor inference metrics, system health, and detection confidence in real-time.
• Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and load balancing to dynamically handle traffic spikes while minimizing infrastructure costs.
